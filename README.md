## Usage 

Link to deployed heroku application: https://fast-refuge-91397.herokuapp.com/

To take notes, simply type your notes in the editor. Sometimes the editor may lose focus. Therefore, clicking on the editor before exiting the page will ensure the entered text gets saved to the database. 

Once notes are saved, users may exit or reload the page how many times they woud like and the notes would stay. 

You can also download the text editor as a web app by clicking on the "Install" button on the upper left corner or by clicking the download icon in the chrome search bar. A prompt would pop up to confirm your installation and the application would automicatically open. The downloaded web application shares the same server and database as the website, therefore, all your notes should remain the same.
